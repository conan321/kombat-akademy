# Kombat Akademy
A strategy guide website for the fighting game *Mortal Kombat 1*. This project was started in 2023 and has since been abandoned (2019 if including the previous installment). All code has been made open source and is free to use. Information and code by Raptor_FGC / RedRaptor10.

The site provides information for character data, frame data, combos, guides, and gameplay. It also includes a Tier Maker for users to create their own tier lists. Much of the site was still in-progress and there was a lot of missing data for combos and guides. All of this required a large effort and ultimately was too much to handle.

*Note: WordPress site, pages, and database must be set up separately if you want to use the site. I will not provide resources for how to set those up.*

## Discontinuation
The project has been discontinued for a combination of reasons: The increasing site costs, too much work and not enough time, having little to no motivation, low interest and little usage from users, lack of support/donations, the poor handling of the game by its developers, personal dislike of the game, bad past experiences, etc. I don't see much reason for me to continue, so I am leaving this project to the community.

## Thank You
